I'm Alvaro Parker 👋 I'm a software developer from Chile currently studying for my Master of Science in Engineering. I'm passionate about software development, low-level programming using languages like Rust, C, C++, or even assembly. I'm also somewhat familiar with reverse engineering. I also have experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and with technologies like Kubernetes (entry level), Docker, CI/CD, ONNX, and more.\nIn my previous jobs I've:\n\n\nWorked integrating machine learning models into production using ONNX with C# and delivering inference services over XMPP using C# and JavaScript.\n\nWorked with Cloudflare streaming for video delivery, storage, and upload using TypeScript, webhooks, and Cloudflare workers.\n\nWorked with Kubernetes to deploy and manage a cluster of worker nodes for simulations.\n\nI've made small contributions to SeaORM, xmpp-rs, Zed code editor,\nTurborepo,\nand even the Linux\nkernel (this one was a really short contribution but it's a start!). I'm hoping to start contributing even more to open source, so if you have a project\nand you are looking for help (especially if it's written in Rust), I would be happy to assist.\nI also like developing web APIs, especially in Go and Rust. Examples of web APIs I made using Go and Rust are Web-console,\nwhich is a website to interact with Docker containers using a command line on the browser, and lab-control, which is software\nto do access control using fingerprint scanning.\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/about/","title":"About"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/","title":"Articles"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase1/":{"body":"CMU Bomb Lab reverse engineering\nThis repo contains the explanation on how I solved the CMU bomb lab on reverse engineering.

So this function probably parse our input to some values.\nThe instructions 6 and 9 recovers the functions arguments from the stack and moves them into the registers ecx and edx so our first argument is at memory address given by the value of the register ecx and the second is given by the value edx.\nWe can check this by putting a breakpoint at instructino 12 on the read_six_numbers function and checking the values at the address pointed by ecx and edx:\n(gdb) b *(read_six_numbers+12)\nBreakpoint 2 at 0x8048fe4\n(gdb) c\nContinuing.\n\nBreakpoint 2, 0x08048fe4 in read_six_numbers ()\n(gdb) x/s $ecx\n0x804b6d0 &lt;input_strings+80&gt;:   \"this is my random string!!\"\n(gdb) x/s $edx\n0xffffd620:     \"\\200\\266\\004\\b\\300\\227\\004\\bH\\326\\377\\377\\b\\222\\004\\b`\\313\\377\\367 \\332\\377\\367h\\326\\377\\377\\203\\212\\004\\bж\\004\\b$\\265\\004\\bh\\326\\377\\377z\\212\\004\\b,\\036\\371\\367\\3442\\327\\367@x\\356\", &lt;incomplete sequence \\367&gt;\n(gdb)\n\nAfter this instructions, we seem to push 8 elements to the stack, these are the arguments to our sscanf function. Which by looking at the manual can see that takes a char *input, a char *format and an arbitrary number of argument to which we put the scanned elements.\nLet's put a breakpoint in instruction 39 to check what is the format string that we are passing to sscanf:\n(gdb) b *(read_six_numbers+39)\nBreakpoint 3 at 0x8048fff\n(gdb) c\nContinuing.\n\nBreakpoint 3, 0x08048fff in read_six_numbers ()\n(gdb) x/s 0x8049b1b\n0x8049b1b:      \"%d %d %d %d %d %d\"\n\nWe are interested in the second argument of sscanf as this is the format string. We can see that the format string is \"%d %d %d %d %d %d\". So we are parsing 6 numbers separated by space.\nAfter executing the sscanf function, we are left with the following instructions\n0x08048fff &lt;+39&gt;:    call   0x8048860 &lt;sscanf@plt&gt;\n0x08049004 &lt;+44&gt;:    add    $0x20,%esp\n0x08049007 &lt;+47&gt;:    cmp    $0x5,%eax\n0x0804900a &lt;+50&gt;:    jg     0x8049011 &lt;read_six_numbers+57&gt;\n0x0804900c &lt;+52&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08049011 &lt;+57&gt;:    mov    %ebp,%esp\n0x08049013 &lt;+59&gt;:    pop    %ebp\n0x08049014 &lt;+60&gt;:    ret\n\nWe can see that we are checking that the return value (stored at register eax) is 5. So we are checking that the scanff function sucesfully scanned 6 elements. If we did scan all of them correctly,\nwe jump to the instruction 57 hence returning the function read_six_numbers. If we couldn't parse 6 numbers, the bomb explotes.\nOk, so we know that the seconds fase expect an input of 6 numbers separated by space \"%d %d %d %d %d %d\" this is parsed by the function read_six_numbers which then returns to the function phase_2 if the parsing was succesfull.\nLet's analyze now what happens on phase_2 after returning from read_six_numbers:\n0x08048b5b &lt;+19&gt;:    call   0x8048fd8 &lt;read_six_numbers&gt;\n0x08048b60 &lt;+24&gt;:    add    $0x10,%esp\n0x08048b63 &lt;+27&gt;:    cmpl   $0x1,-0x18(%ebp)\n0x08048b67 &lt;+31&gt;:    je     0x8048b6e &lt;phase_2+38&gt;\n0x08048b69 &lt;+33&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08048b6e &lt;+38&gt;:    mov    $0x1,%ebx\n0x08048b73 &lt;+43&gt;:    lea    -0x18(%ebp),%esi\n0x08048b76 &lt;+46&gt;:    lea    0x1(%ebx),%eax\n0x08048b79 &lt;+49&gt;:    imul   -0x4(%esi,%ebx,4),%eax\n0x08048b7e &lt;+54&gt;:    cmp    %eax,(%esi,%ebx,4)\n0x08048b81 &lt;+57&gt;:    je     0x8048b88 &lt;phase_2+64&gt;\n0x08048b83 &lt;+59&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08048b88 &lt;+64&gt;:    inc    %ebx\n0x08048b89 &lt;+65&gt;:    cmp    $0x5,%ebx\n0x08048b8c &lt;+68&gt;:    jle    0x8048b76 &lt;phase_2+46&gt;\n0x08048b8e &lt;+70&gt;:    lea    -0x28(%ebp),%esp\n0x08048b91 &lt;+73&gt;:    pop    %ebx\n0x08048b92 &lt;+74&gt;:    pop    %esi\n0x08048b93 &lt;+75&gt;:    mov    %ebp,%esp\n0x08048b95 &lt;+77&gt;:    pop    %ebp\n0x08048b96 &lt;+78&gt;:    ret\n\nWe see that we adjust our %esp (Pointer to the top of the stack) by adding 0x10 (16 in decimal) and hence decreacing the stack by 16 bytes. Next we compare the first scanned number that sscanf with 0x1 at instruction 27:\n0x08048b63 &lt;+27&gt;:    cmpl   $0x1,-0x18(%ebp)\n0x08048b67 &lt;+31&gt;:    je     0x8048b6e &lt;phase_2+38&gt;\n\nIf the first scanned number is equal to 1, we continue. If it's not equal, we explote the bomb. That's it! We got our first element! Our input are 6 numbers separated by space and now we know that the first number must be equal to 1 to prevent the bomb from exploting.\nNow let's continue analyzing the next instructinos. After checking that our first number is 1, we then jump to instruction 38:\n0x08048b6e &lt;+38&gt;:    mov    $0x1,%ebx\n0x08048b73 &lt;+43&gt;:    lea    -0x18(%ebp),%esi\n0x08048b76 &lt;+46&gt;:    lea    0x1(%ebx),%eax\n0x08048b79 &lt;+49&gt;:    imul   -0x4(%esi,%ebx,4),%eax\n0x08048b7e &lt;+54&gt;:    cmp    %eax,(%esi,%ebx,4)\n0x08048b81 &lt;+57&gt;:    je     0x8048b88 &lt;phase_2+64&gt;\n0x08048b83 &lt;+59&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08048b88 &lt;+64&gt;:    inc    %ebx\n0x08048b89 &lt;+65&gt;:    cmp    $0x5,%ebx\n0x08048b8c &lt;+68&gt;:    jle    0x8048b76 &lt;phase_2+46&gt;\n0x08048b8e &lt;+70&gt;:    lea    -0x28(%ebp),%esp\n0x08048b91 &lt;+73&gt;:    pop    %ebx\n0x08048b92 &lt;+74&gt;:    pop    %esi\n0x08048b93 &lt;+75&gt;:    mov    %ebp,%esp\n0x08048b95 &lt;+77&gt;:    pop    %ebp\n0x08048b96 &lt;+78&gt;:    ret\n\nBefore anaylzing line by line, let's notice a thing first,on instruction 64, 65 and 68 we are definining the conditions for a loop. We increase the %ebx, we compare it to %0x5 and if if is\nless or equal we continue the loop, if it's greater, we break the loop. To continue the loop we jump to the instruction at 46. So we have a loop defined between instructions 46 and 68. Now let's analyze\nthe 2 instructions before the loop (38 and 43):\n0x08048b6e &lt;+38&gt;:    mov    $0x1,%ebx\n0x08048b73 &lt;+43&gt;:    lea    -0x18(%ebp),%esi\n\nOn instruction 38 we mov the value to ebx. Remember that ebx is used to break the loop we described before. So we initialize ebx and the load the effective address -0x18(%ebp) into the esi register. This address contains the first\nelement of our array of scanned number.\nSo after this 2 instruction we initialize the loop.\nLet's analyze the loop, remeber that the initial value of our ebx register is 0x1 (1 in decimal)\n0x08048b76 &lt;+46&gt;:    lea    0x1(%ebx),%eax\n0x08048b79 &lt;+49&gt;:    imul   -0x4(%esi,%ebx,4),%eax\n0x08048b7e &lt;+54&gt;:    cmp    %eax,(%esi,%ebx,4)\n0x08048b81 &lt;+57&gt;:    je     0x8048b88 &lt;phase_2+64&gt;\n0x08048b83 &lt;+59&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08048b88 &lt;+64&gt;:    inc    %ebx\n0x08048b89 &lt;+65&gt;:    cmp    $0x5,%ebx\n0x08048b8c &lt;+68&gt;:    jle    0x8048b76 &lt;phase_2+46&gt;\n\nSo let's iterative one time and let's consider arr is the array of the numbers we passed as input.\n\nInstruction 46 adds 1 to ebx and stores it in eax, so in our current iteration eax is 2\nimul we multiply the element at arr[ebx - 1] with eax and store it in eax. So in this case arr[ebx - 1] * eax = arr[1 - 1] * 2 = arr[0]*2= 1*2 = 2\nWe compare the previous multiplication stored at eax with the element at index ebx (arr[ebx]) and if they are equal we continue, so we compare 2 with arr[1]. If arr[1] == 2 we continue, else, we explote the bomb\n\nGreat so we have an understanding of how it works. Let's make it in C:\nint arr[6] = load_six_numbers();\nint counter = 1\nwhile (counter &lt;= 5) {\n int mult = arr[counter - 1]*(counter + 1);\n if (mult == arr[counter]) {\n  // continue\n } else {\n  explote_bomb();\n }\n counter++;\n}\n\nWe have to create an array that can pass this while loop so our function returns. For each element index i at the array, the following condition has to be true\narr[i] == arr[i - 1] * (i + 1)\n\nLet's calculate arr[1]:\narr[1] = arr[1 - 1] * (1 + 1) = arr[0] * 2 =  1 * 2 = 2\n\nWe now know that arr[1] = 2, let's do it for arr[2]:\narr[2] = arr[2 - 1] (2 + 1) = arr[1] * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6\n\nWe have that arr[2] = 6. Now for the rest of the elements:\narr[3] = arr[2] * (4) = 6 * 4 = 24\narr[4] = arr[3] * (5) = 24 * 5 = 120\narr [5] = arr[4] * 6 = 120 * 6 = 720\n\nSo the solutions gives us: 1 2 6 24 120 720\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase2/","title":"CMU Bomb Lab Phase 2"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase3/":{"body":"CMU Bomb Lab reverse engineering\nPhase 3\nWe have reached phase 3.

After this we set up a call to the function sscanf by pushing the parameters to the stack:\n0x08048b9f &lt;+7&gt;:     mov    edx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n0x08048ba2 &lt;+10&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff4\n0x08048ba5 &lt;+13&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebp-0x4]\n0x08048ba8 &lt;+16&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048ba9 &lt;+17&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebp-0x5]\n0x08048bac &lt;+20&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048bad &lt;+21&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebp-0xc]\n0x08048bb0 &lt;+24&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048bb1 &lt;+25&gt;:    push   0x80497de\n0x08048bb6 &lt;+30&gt;:    push   edx\n0x08048bb7 &lt;+31&gt;:    call   0x8048860 &lt;sscanf@plt&gt;\n\nWe push 5 parameters on reverse order, meaning that the first parameters pushed is the last function parameter. The last two parameters %edx and 0x80497de are the memory address of the input string and the format string in that order.\nThe first 3 parameters are the pointers where we will save the scanned elements.\nWe can check the format string to see what the phase_3 function expects our input to be:\n(gdb) x/s 0x80497de\n0x80497de:      \"%d %c %d\"\n\nSo we can see the phase_3 expects an integer, followed by a spaces, then a character, then a space and finally an integer.\nAfter scanning the two numbers and the char, we check that the scanned was sucesfull by checking the return value of sscanf (stored in the eax register) is greater than 2:\n0x8048bbc &lt;phase_3+36&gt;  add    esp,0x20\n0x8048bbf &lt;phase_3+39&gt;  cmp    eax,0x2 # &lt;- we compare it with two\n0x8048bc2 &lt;phase_3+42&gt;  jg     0x8048bc9 &lt;phase_3+49&gt;\n0x8048bc4 &lt;phase_3+44&gt;  call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n&gt;0x8048bc9 &lt;phase_3+49&gt;  cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],0x7\n\nIf the value is greater than two, meaning the scan was a success, we continue, if not, we explode the bomb\nThen we make a second compartion, with 0x7 and ebp-0xc (the first number we provided). If the first number we suplide is bigger than 7 the bomb explotes (we jump to instruction 240 which is the function to explode the bomb)\n0x8048bc9 &lt;phase_3+49&gt;  cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],0x7\n0x8048bcd &lt;phase_3+53&gt;  ja     0x8048c88 &lt;phase_3+240&gt;\n0x8048bd3 &lt;phase_3+59&gt;  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc]\n0x8048bd6 &lt;phase_3+62&gt;  jmp    DWORD PTR [eax*4+0x80497e8]\n\nIf we provided a value less or equal than 7, we continue to instruction 59 which moves the first value we provided, to the register %eax. Then we find a jpm instruction that depends on the value that's at the eax register.\nThis is also known as a switch statement in C.\nOk, so far we figured that we have to provide an input in the format of &lt;integer&gt; &lt;character&gt; &lt;integer&gt; and that the first integer we provide has to be less or equal than 7.\nLet's check what happens if the first number is, for example 6. We jump to the instruction [0x6*4+0x80497e8]. To check this, our input will be of 6 c 10\nWe end on the following instrucion:\n&gt;0x8048c64 &lt;phase_3+204&gt; mov    bl,0x76\n0x8048c66 &lt;phase_3+206&gt; cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x30c\n0x8048c6d &lt;phase_3+213&gt; je     0x8048c8f &lt;phase_3+247&gt;\n0x8048c6f &lt;phase_3+215&gt; call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x8048c74 &lt;phase_3+220&gt; jmp    0x8048c8f &lt;phase_3+247&gt;\n\nThe instruction 204 moves the value 0x76 to the bl register, the following expresion compares the second number that we input with the value 0x30c and if they are equal we jump to the instruction 247, and if they are not equal, the bomb explotes.\nGreat, now we now that if our first number has to be equal to 7 and our second number has to be equal to 0x30c which is 780 in decimal value.\nLet's restart our program with an input \"6 c 780\" to be able to jump to the instruction 247:\n&gt;0x8048c8f &lt;phase_3+247&gt; cmp    bl,BYTE PTR [ebp-0x5]\n0x8048c92 &lt;phase_3+250&gt; je     0x8048c99 &lt;phase_3+257&gt;\n0x8048c94 &lt;phase_3+252&gt; call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x8048c99 &lt;phase_3+257&gt; mov    ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x18]\n0x8048c9c &lt;phase_3+260&gt; mov    esp,ebp\n0x8048c9e &lt;phase_3+262&gt; pop    ebp\n0x8048c9f &lt;phase_3+263&gt; ret\n\nWe are almost at the end of the phase_3 function! We can see that the instruction 247 compares the register we set on the previous section (bl register) with the value of the character we input (accesible via BYTE PTR [ebp-0x5]) and if they are equal, it jumps to the end of the function, and if not, the bomb explotes.\nAwesome, so now we know that our character has to have the ASCII value of the be register we set on the previous section, which in this case is 0x76.

This is a pointer to the scanned value that sscanf will produce. Next we push an address 0x8049808, let's check what's the content of this address using gdb:\n(gdb) x/s 0x8049808\n0x8049808:      \"%d\"\n\nHuh, so the format string that we pass to sscanf is \"%d\" which means the function expects a number!\nWe can also check the memory that edx register is pointing to:\n(gdb) x/s $edx\n0x804b770 &lt;input_strings+240&gt;:  \"10\"\n\nSo we now know that we have a function call that in C might look like this:\nint num;\nsscanf(\"&lt;input string&gt;\", \"%d\", &amp;num);\n\nAfter this, the instructions 30 and 33 check if the function sscanf succesfully scanned the input string, and if not, it triggers the bomb by jumping to instruction 41. After this, if our sscanf was a success, we go to instruction\ninstruction 35 which checks if our input is greater than 0, if it's not, the bomb explotes by continuing to instruction 41, if it is greater than 0, we go to instruction 46\nLet's analyze the next portion of the phase_4 function, assuming that our input was correct and greater than 0:\n0x08048d0e &lt;+46&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff4\n0x08048d11 &lt;+49&gt;:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]\n0x08048d14 &lt;+52&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048d15 &lt;+53&gt;:    call   0x8048ca0 &lt;func4&gt;\n0x08048d1a &lt;+58&gt;:    add    esp,0x10\n0x08048d1d &lt;+61&gt;:    cmp    eax,0x37\n0x08048d20 &lt;+64&gt;:    je     0x8048d27 &lt;phase_4+71&gt;\n0x08048d22 &lt;+66&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08048d27 &lt;+71&gt;:    mov    esp,ebp\n0x08048d29 &lt;+73&gt;:    pop    ebp\n0x08048d2a &lt;+74&gt;:    ret\n\nWe allocate some space on the stack on the first instruction, we move the number we scanned with the previous sscanf call to the eax register, we push the register to the stack and we call the func4 function.\nAfter this function returns, we compare the return value it produced (that's on the eax register) with the literal 0x37. If the return value is equal to 0x37 we jump to instruction 71 which returns the phase_4 function, hence passing this phase.\nOk, so far we know that we have to input a number on phase 4, that number has to be greater than 0, and then this number is used as a parameter to call the func4 function, which returns a value that is then compared with the literal 0x37, if the return value is\nequal to 0x37 we pass the phase, if not, we explote the bomb.\nLet's analyze func4 to check what our input value should be such that the func4 returns a value equal to 0x37. Disassembling the function with disass func4 returns:\n0x08048ca0 &lt;+0&gt;:     push   ebp\n0x08048ca1 &lt;+1&gt;:     mov    ebp,esp\n0x08048ca3 &lt;+3&gt;:     sub    esp,0x10\n0x08048ca6 &lt;+6&gt;:     push   esi\n0x08048ca7 &lt;+7&gt;:     push   ebx\n0x08048ca8 &lt;+8&gt;:     mov    ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n0x08048cab &lt;+11&gt;:    cmp    ebx,0x1\n0x08048cae &lt;+14&gt;:    jle    0x8048cd0 &lt;func4+48&gt;\n0x08048cb0 &lt;+16&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff4\n0x08048cb3 &lt;+19&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebx-0x1]\n0x08048cb6 &lt;+22&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048cb7 &lt;+23&gt;:    call   0x8048ca0 &lt;func4&gt;\n0x08048cbc &lt;+28&gt;:    mov    esi,eax\n0x08048cbe &lt;+30&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff4\n0x08048cc1 &lt;+33&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebx-0x2]\n0x08048cc4 &lt;+36&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048cc5 &lt;+37&gt;:    call   0x8048ca0 &lt;func4&gt;\n0x08048cca &lt;+42&gt;:    add    eax,esi\n0x08048ccc &lt;+44&gt;:    jmp    0x8048cd5 &lt;func4+53&gt;\n0x08048cce &lt;+46&gt;:    mov    esi,esi\n0x08048cd0 &lt;+48&gt;:    mov    eax,0x1\n0x08048cd5 &lt;+53&gt;:    lea    esp,[ebp-0x18]\n0x08048cd8 &lt;+56&gt;:    pop    ebx\n0x08048cd9 &lt;+57&gt;:    pop    esi\n0x08048cda &lt;+58&gt;:    mov    esp,ebp\n0x08048cdc &lt;+60&gt;:    pop    ebp\n0x08048cdd &lt;+61&gt;:    ret\n\nThere are 3 main part on this function, the prologue (+ some other instructions) the central part of the function which is the one that produces the return value, and the epilogue.\nLet's analyze the prologue:\n0x08048ca0 &lt;+0&gt;:     push   ebp\n0x08048ca1 &lt;+1&gt;:     mov    ebp,esp\n0x08048ca3 &lt;+3&gt;:     sub    esp,0x10\n0x08048ca6 &lt;+6&gt;:     push   esi\n0x08048ca7 &lt;+7&gt;:     push   ebx\n0x08048ca8 &lt;+8&gt;:     mov    ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n0x08048cab &lt;+11&gt;:    cmp    ebx,0x1\n0x08048cae &lt;+14&gt;:    jle    0x8048cd0 &lt;func4+48&gt;\n\nBetween instructions 0 and 7 we see the function prologue and some stack allocation. After this, on instruction 8 we load the parameter of the function func4 to the register ebx. This means that if in phase 4 we input a string \"5\", then the ebx register will store an int value 5.\nAfter this, on instruction 11 it compares the function parameter with 1, if they are less or equal than 1, then it jump to instructino 48 which is the start of the function prologue which returns the same value ebx .\nOk, so we now know that our function looks something like this in C code :\nint func4(int num) {\n  if (num &lt;= 1) {\n    return num;\n  } else {\n    // Do some stuff\n  }\n}\n\nLet's analyze what happens on the else, this is between instructions 16 and 44\n0x08048cb0 &lt;+16&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff4\n0x08048cb3 &lt;+19&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebx-0x1]\n0x08048cb6 &lt;+22&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048cb7 &lt;+23&gt;:    call   0x8048ca0 &lt;func4&gt;\n0x08048cbc &lt;+28&gt;:    mov    esi,eax\n0x08048cbe &lt;+30&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff4\n0x08048cc1 &lt;+33&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebx-0x2]\n0x08048cc4 &lt;+36&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048cc5 &lt;+37&gt;:    call   0x8048ca0 &lt;func4&gt;\n0x08048cca &lt;+42&gt;:    add    eax,esi\n0x08048ccc &lt;+44&gt;:    jmp    0x8048cd5 &lt;func4+53&gt;\n\nBy taking a quick look, we see that we are calling the same func4 function on func4 body (on isntructions 23 and 37), this means we are dealing with a recursive function.\nOn the first call, we substract 1 from ebx (our input parameter) by using lea instruction, we then store that result on eax, push eax to the stack and call func4 with eax as a parameter. So we are calling func4 with our original functino parameter minus 1.\nAfter this, we save the return value of that function call into the esi register.\nOn the second call, we do something similar, but instead of calling func4 with our original function parameter minus 1, we call it minus 2 (instruction 33 is lea    eax,[ebx-0x2] which substract 2 from our parameter and stores it in eax)\nFinallly we add esi (return value of the first call) with eax (return value of the second call) and we jump to instruction 53\nOr C code now looks something like this:\nint func4(int num) {\n  if (num &lt;= 1) {\n    return num;\n  } else {\n    return func4(num - 1) - func4(num - 2);\n  }\n}\n\nDoes this function sounds familiar? (Hint: It's the Fibonacci sequence)\nGreat, so now we know that our input on phase 4 has to be an integer greater than 0, that if we put it into the fibonacci function, it returns 0x37 which is 55 in decimal. This number is 10, because the 10th value of the Fibonacci sequence is 55.\nHowever this function adds 1 from our input, so if we input 10, it will return the 11th number of the Fibonacci sequence, so the get 55 we have to input 9.\nFinal solution then is 9!\nnote: Idk why it does one more iteration of the sequence, for example if 10 is provided, it returns 89 isntead of 55\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase4/","title":"CMU Bomb Lab Phase 4"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase5/":{"body":"CMU Bomb Lab reverse engineering\nPhase 5\nWe've reached phase 5.

We can verify this in gdb doing:\n(gdb) x/s $ebx\n0x804b7c0 &lt;input_strings+320&gt;:  \"hello\"\n\nThen we have the second section:\n# Section 2\n0x08048d4d &lt;+33&gt;:    xor    edx,edx # set edx to 0\n0x08048d4f &lt;+35&gt;:    lea    ecx,[ebp-0x8] # Load address ebp-0x8 to ecx\n0x08048d52 &lt;+38&gt;:    mov    esi,0x804b220 # load string pointer to esi\n\nOn the first instruction we set the edx register to 0, then we load the address ebp-0x8 to the ecx register and finally we load the number 0x804b220 to the register esi, this address points to a string (char *) which we canc check by doing:\n(gdb) x/s 0x804b220\n0x804b220:      \"isrveawhobpnutfg\"\n\nNow, in the third section, thing get interesting.\n0x08048d57 &lt;+43&gt;:    mov    al,BYTE PTR [edx+ebx*1] # `ebx` stores the pointer to our string.

Let's figure it out.\nWe know the counter that increases for each loop is the edx register. We also use this register to access a specific char (BYTE) on the string we input on the phase 5 and move that char to the register al:\n0x08048d57 &lt;+43&gt;:    mov    al,BYTE PTR [edx+ebx*1] # `ebx` stores the pointer to our string. This acceses character at position edx of the string and loads it to al\n0x08048d5a &lt;+46&gt;:    and    al,0xf # Make &amp; operation with the character and 0xf which is 15 in decimal\n\nWe then make an and operation with that char and the number 0xf (15 in decimal) and store it back to the al register.\nAfter this, we move the al value to the eax register.\nThen on instruction 51 and 54 we have:\n0x08048d5f &lt;+51&gt;:    mov    al,BYTE PTR [eax+esi*1] # move character at position eax of string at esi to register al\n0x08048d62 &lt;+54&gt;:    mov    BYTE PTR [edx+ecx*1],al # move al register to\n\nRemember, the esi register has a pointer to the string literal \"isrveawhobpnutfg\", so we are now accesing a character on that string by the index number that's on the eax register and moving that character to the al register.\nFinally we move the value at the al register to the memory address that's on ecx with an offset given by the current edx value (which increases for each iteration on the loop)\nAfter this, we increase the edx value and if it's greater than 5, we break the loop, if not, we continue.\nAfter breaking the loop (edx register is now greater than 5) we go to the section 4 of the function:\n0x08048d6b &lt;+63&gt;:    mov    BYTE PTR [ebp-0x2],0x0\n0x08048d6f &lt;+67&gt;:    add    esp,0xfffffff8\n0x08048d72 &lt;+70&gt;:    push   0x804980b\n0x08048d77 &lt;+75&gt;:    lea    eax,[ebp-0x8]\n0x08048d7a &lt;+78&gt;:    push   eax\n0x08048d7b &lt;+79&gt;:    call   0x8049030 &lt;strings_not_equal&gt;\n0x08048d80 &lt;+84&gt;:    add    esp,0x10\n0x08048d83 &lt;+87&gt;:    test   eax,eax\n0x08048d85 &lt;+89&gt;:    je     0x8048d8c &lt;phase_5+96&gt;\n0x08048d87 &lt;+91&gt;:    call   0x80494fc &lt;explode_bomb&gt;\n0x08048d8c &lt;+96&gt;:    lea    esp,[ebp-0x18]\n0x08048d8f &lt;+99&gt;:    pop    ebx\n0x08048d90 &lt;+100&gt;:   pop    esi\n0x08048d91 &lt;+101&gt;:   mov    esp,ebp\n0x08048d93 &lt;+103&gt;:   pop    ebp\n0x08048d94 &lt;+104&gt;:   ret\n\nIn this section we are calling a function strings_not_equal with a pointer to a string literal on address 0x804980b and the string we build which memory address is\non the register eax\nAfter calling this function, we test if the strings are equal, if they are, we continue execution on instruction 96, if they are not equal, the bomb explotes.\nWe can check the value of the string literal we are comparing our new string:\n(gdb) x/s 0x804980b\n0x804980b:      \"giants\"\n\nHmm, so our new string has to be equal to the string \"giant\".\nNow we know that when we enter phase 6 and give an input, it has to be of length 6, the input will be used to iterate over each character and do an binary and operation with the character and 0xf and the result of that will be the index we will use to access a char in the string \"isrveawhobpnutfg\", then we will take that char and append it to the new string. Once our string has length 6, we break the loop and check if it's equal to \"giants\", if it is, we pass phase 5, if it's not, the bomb explotes.\nWe can build the algorithm used to create the new string in python:\nnew_str = \"\";\nrandom_string = \"isrveawhobpnutfg\"\nfor i in my_str:\n  index = i &amp; 0xf\n  new_str += random_string[index]\nreturn new_str\n\nTo build our string, we have to access index [15, 0, 5, 11, 13, 1] in that order so for each of those values we have to find an x wich when doing x &amp; 0xf returns the value on that array.\nfor each n in [15, 0, 5, 11, 13, 1] we need x such that x % 0xf == n\n\nWe also want x to be between 32 and 122 to be a nice printable ASCII value.\nTo get the list of valid number we can do a simple python script:\nfrom typing import List\n\nvalues = [15, 0, 5, 11, 13, 1]\n\n\ndef get_valid_chars(x: int) -&gt; List[str]:\n    valid = []\n    for i in range(32, 122, 1):\n        if i &amp; 0xF == x:\n            valid.append(chr(i))\n    return valid\n\n\nfor i in values:\n    print(get_valid_chars(i))\n\nRunning the script\n$ python solve.py\n['/', '?', 'O', '_', 'o']\n[' ', '0', '@', 'P', '`', 'p']\n['%', '5', 'E', 'U', 'e', 'u']\n['+', ';', 'K', '[', 'k']\n['-', '=', 'M', ']', 'm']\n['!', '1', 'A', 'Q', 'a', 'q']\n\nSo for each list on that output we choose one character, an arbitrary solution would be \"?pukmq\"\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase5/","title":"CMU Bomb Lab Phase 5"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/cmu-phase6/":{"body":"CMU Bomb Lab reverse engineering\nPhase 6 -

post assumes you followed the installation guide on Secure-Arch (credits to Ataraxxia). This means you have Arch installed with a Unified Kernel Image, encrypted with LVM and secure boot enabled.\nCreating a swapfile\nThe first things you'll need to enable hibernation on this specific configuration is to create a swap file. I don't like using swap partitions simply because that would imply I'll have to encrypt that partition as well and I don't want to read the docs to do that.\nSo, following the Arch Linux wiki on swap files, we can create a new one by doing:\n# mkswap -U clear --size 12G --file /swapfile\n\nI'll choose 12G becuase my current laptop has roughly 6G. The general rule to choose swap size is:\n\n2 GB or less of RAM: Swap should be at least 2x the amount of RAM.\n2 GB to 8 GB of RAM: Swap can be equal to the amount of RAM or up to 1.5x the RAM.\n8 GB to 16 GB of RAM: Swap can be equal to the amount of RAM or slightly less (e.g., 0.5x to 1x the RAM).\nMore than 16 GB of RAM: Swap size is often equal to the RAM size or even smaller (e.g., 4 GB to 8 GB), depending on your needs.\n\nNow to enable the swap file:\n# swapon /swapfile\n\nAnd too keep it across reboots we can add the following line to /etc/fstab\n/etc/fstab\n    /swapfile none swap defaults 0 0\n\nGreat! Now we have swap enabled on our system. You can check that by doing\nfree\n\nAnd you should see something like this on your terminal\n               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:         7034596     4476296      471520       67164     2432656     2558300\nSwap:       12582908     2605912     9976996\n\nEnabling hibernation\nTo enable hibernation, we will need to add two kernel parameters to our configuration. The first one is resume to tell the kernel in which device the swapfile is and the second one is resume_offset to tell the kernel in which part of the device (aka offset) the swapfile is located.\nGet resume parameter\nFor the resume parameter, we will use the UUID of the disk that contains the swapfile. To find the UUID value first you'll need to know in which disk your swapfile is:\ndf -h /swapfile\n\nYou should see an output like this:\nFilesystem           Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/vg-root  305G   80G  210G  28% /\n\nWhich indicates that the /swapfile is on device /dev/mapper/vg-root. Now to get the UUID of that device we can do:\nsudo blkid /dev/mapper/vg-root\n\nWich should return something like this:\n/dev/mapper/vg-root: UUID=\"df9c76a1-25bc-4f83-8569-c9425a86115d\" BLOCK_SIZE=\"4096\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nGreat! So now we have our first kernel parameter value. Now let's get the second one.\nGet resume_offset parameter\nYou can check the Arch wiki article for this as well.\nTo get the resume_offset value, we can run the following command:\nsudo filefrag -v /swapfile\n\nWhich should return something like this:\nFilesystem type is: ef53\nFile size of /swapfile is 4294967296 (1048576 blocks of 4096 bytes)\n ext:     logical_offset:        physical_offset: length:   expected: flags:\n   0:        0..       0:      38912..     38912:      1:\n   1:        1..   22527:      38913..     61439:  22527:             unwritten\n   2:    22528..   53247:     899072..    929791:  30720:      61440: unwritten\n...\n\nWe are interested in the first physical_offset value which in this case is 38912. You can also get the direct value of the offset by using awk\nsudo filefrag -v swap_file | awk '$1==\"0:\" {print substr($4, 1, length($4)-2)}'\n\nAdding the parameter to the kernel cmd line\nNow that we have the uuid of the device where the /swapfile is and the offset of the /swapfile file in this device, we can add the values to the kernel parameters.\nRemeber that the value we found previously where \"df9c76a1-25bc-4f83-8569-c9425a86115d\" for the UUID of the disk and 38912 for the offset of the /swapfile. Now well need to tell the kernel this so it can be able to find the /swapfile on boot.\nTo do this in dracut open the /etc/dracut.conf.d/cmdline.conf file, where you should see something like this:\nkernel_cmdline=\"rd.lunks.uuid=luks-42eb3f89-15a3-427c-9cab-8bcc8d19f94c rd.lvm.lv=vg/root root=/dev/mapper/vg-root rootfstype=ext4 rootflags=rw,relatime\"\n\nNow simply add the resume and resume_offset parameters. At the end of the line and remember to close with a quote character. Also for the resume parameter, you'll need to tell the kernel you are providing the UUID of the device, this is simply done by appending =UUID after resume (so your kernel parameter should look like resume=UUID=&lt;uuid of the device&gt;):\nYour cmdline.conf file should now look like this:\nkernel_cmdline=\"rd.lunks.uuid=luks-42eb3f89-15a3-427c-9cab-8bcc8d19f94c rd.lvm.lv=vg/root root=/dev/mapper/vg-root rootfstype=ext4 rootflags=rw,relatime resume=UUID=df9c76a1-25bc-4f83-8569-c9425a86115d resume_offset=38912\"\n\nRebuilding your unified kernel image\nNot sure if this step is needed, but I do it anyway. To rebuild the unified kernel image I simply reinstall the linux kernel:\nsudo pacman -S linux\n\nSome tips\nIf you have enough ram and you just want swap in your system for hibernation, you can configure the swappiness on your devices such that it is never actually used.\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/hibernation-linux/","title":"How to configure hibernation with a swap file and encrypted root partition"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/selfhosting-nextjs-with-cloudflare/":{"body":"Self-Hosting a Next.js Application\nA small team of devs and I had the task of developing a small e-learning platform that needed to include the following features:\n\nCreate courses\nCreate professors\nPay for courses\nAdd modules to a course\nAdd videos and files (resources) to modules within a course\nAllow users to log in\nProvide an admin dashboard to manage the website\n\nUsing something like Moodle would have been overkill and didn’t include all the features the client wanted, so that was out of the question. Hence, we decided to develop our own platform using Next.js and Turborepo. We split the platform into three applications: services for the API endpoints, admin for the administrator dashboard, and web for the public view of the platform.\nThe Stack\nTo host and stream our videos, we first considered using YouTube for simplicity. However, since we couldn’t protect the URLs from unauthorized access, we ruled it out. Instead, we chose Cloudflare Stream, which offers restricted video access using signed URLs. This allowed us to generate signed URLs valid for a limited time and prevent unauthorized downloads.\nTo store files and dynamic content like profile pictures, we chose to use S3-compatible object storage. We didn’t want to store files on the same server hosting the websites, especially since we weren’t yet sure whether we would self-host. To decouple file storage from the app, we opted for object storage. During development, we used Adobe’s S3 mock implementation in Docker, so we didn’t need to set up an AWS account yet.\nFor the database, we chose PostgreSQL with Prisma, which is one of the most widely used ORMs with Next.js.\nDeploying on a VPS\nAfter development, we reached the final stage: deploying the website for production. We had a few deployment options but ended up self-hosting due to internal reasons and client requirements. My responsibility was to deploy the site and \"make sure it was fast.\"\nConsidering the many blog posts explaining why self-hosting a Next.js application might not be ideal (see the Open Next project and ThePrimeagen’s interview with the lead dev), I took on the challenge of making it work as well as possible—even though Next.js is not typically deployed in this fashion.\nMy first step was deploying the Turborepo project behind an NGINX reverse proxy. I created one Docker image to run all three apps. Each app exposes an internal port in a docker-compose.yml file, which is then accessed by a container running NGINX. The NGINX container exposes ports 80 and 443 to the internet:\n                    +------------------------+\n                    |     Public Internet    |\n                    +-----------+------------+\n                                |\n                         (Public IP: 80/443)\n                                |\n                     +----------v-----------+\n                     |     NGINX Proxy      |\n                     |  (Docker container)  |\n                     | Ports: 80, 443 (host)|\n                     +----------+-----------+\n                                |\n       +------------------------+-------------------------+\n       |                        |                         |\n   / --&gt; port 3000         /admin --&gt; port 4000     /api --&gt; port 5000\n       |                        |                         |\n+------v-----+          +-------v-----+           +-------v------+\n|  Next.js   |          |  Next.js    |           |  Next.js     |\n|   App: web |          | App: admin  |           | App: service |\n+------|-----+          +------|------+           +-------|------+\n       |                       |                          |\n       +-----------------------+--------------------------+\n                               |\n                         Internal Access to:\n                         +-------------------+\n                         |   PostgreSQL DB   |\n                         | (Docker port 5432)|\n                         +-------------------+\n                                  ^\n                                  |\n                    +-------------+-------------+\n                    |   TurboRepo Docker Image   |\n                    | (Runs all 3 Next.js apps)  |\n                    +-------------+-------------+\n                                  |\n                    +-------------v-------------+\n                    |     Docker Compose File    |\n                    | (Defines 3 containers:     |\n                    |  nginx, turbo, postgres)   |\n                    +----------------------------+\n\nThis setup ran on the VPS with only ports 80 and 443 exposed to the internet. The PostgreSQL database was accessible only at the Docker network level. NGINX routed requests to /, /admin/*, or /api/* to the appropriate Next.js app.\nWith S3 deployed on AWS and API keys configured via .env files, the deployment was ready for production. We just needed to configure the A record on Cloudflare DNS for domain access. But we could do better—by leveraging one of Cloudflare’s key features: caching.\nCaching on the Edge\nLet’s first define edge caching: it involves storing frequently accessed content on servers closer to the end user, such as edge servers. For example, if users are in Brazil and the VPS is in Chile, edge caching allows requests to be served faster from nearby servers.\n\n                            [ User Requests ]\n                                  |\n                                  v\n                       +-----------------------+\n                       |   Global Load Balancer|\n                       +-----------------------+\n                          /         |         \\\n                         /          |          \\\n                        v           v           v\n                +------------+ +------------+ +------------+\n                | Edge Cache | | Edge Cache | | Edge Cache |\n                |  Server 1  | |  Server 2  | |  Server 3  |\n                +------------+ +------------+ +------------+\n                  |   |   |        |   |   |       |   |   |\n                  |   |   |        |   |   |       |   |   |\n      [img, css, js]  |   |   [img, css, js]  |   [img, css, js]\n                      |   |                  |\n                      |   v                  v\n                   (MISS or Expired)     (MISS or Expired)\n                      |                      |\n                      v                      v\n                    +-----------------------------+\n                    |       VPS (Origin Server)   |\n                    |   Runs website (HTML, API)  |\n                    +-----------------------------+\n\nWe configured Cloudflare cache rules to target:\n\n/_next/static/*\n/images/*\n/fonts/*\n/_next/image*\n\nRequests to these paths ignore the Cache-Control headers sent by Next.js and apply a one-year TTL on both the edge and the browser. This way, follow-up requests are faster—either from the browser cache or Cloudflare’s edge cache.\nMigrating to R2\nEverything worked fine, and deployment was a success. But I overlooked an important issue: the S3 images for courses and profile pictures weren’t being cached, slowing down page loads. We could’ve solved this using Amazon CloudFront, but mixing providers didn’t feel ideal. Since the app was \"production-ready\" but not yet launched, we decided to migrate to Cloudflare R2.\nR2 offers free-tier egress and lets us cache public assets using Workers.\nHere's how it works: we had publicly available files named like public-&lt;uuid&gt;. We set up a Cloudflare Worker accessible via &lt;WORKER_URL&gt;/public-&lt;UUID&gt;, which serves R2 objects and caches them at the edge. The Worker looks like this:\nexport default {\n async fetch(request, env) {\n  const key = some_fn(); // some function to get the key\n\n  if (!key.startsWith('public-')) {\n   return new Response('Forbidden', { status: 403 });\n  }\n\n  ... // Some internal logic\n  // Fetch from R2:\n  const object = await env.MY_BUCKET.get(key);\n  if (!object) {\n   return new Response('Object Not Found', { status: 404 });\n  }\n\n  const headers = new Headers();\n  object.writeHttpMetadata(headers);\n  headers.set('etag', object.httpEtag);\n  headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000');\n\n  response = new Response(object.body, { headers });\n\n  // Store in edge cache for future requests\n  await cache.put(request, response.clone());\n  return response;\n }\n}\n\nNow, when users visit the landing page and request profile pictures or course thumbnails, the assets are cached at the edge, reducing load times and improving responsiveness.\nThe TLDR on our caching strategy\nTo optimize performance and reduce latency, we implemented multiple layers of caching using Cloudflare. Static assets such as JavaScript, CSS, fonts, and images served by the Next.js application were cached at the edge by configuring page rules for paths like /_next/static/*, /images/*, /fonts/*, and /_next/image*, with a one-year TTL applied both at the edge and in the browser. Additionally, we leveraged Cloudflare R2 for storing public files and used a Worker to serve these assets via a /public-&lt;UUID&gt; URL pattern. The Worker not only enforced access control but also applied long-term caching headers and stored the responses in the edge cache. Together, these strategies significantly improved load times and responsiveness across geographically distributed users.\nFinal Notes\nWhile self-hosting a Next.js project isn’t always the best approach, sometimes it’s necessary. If you go that route, make sure you take full advantage of your provider's caching capabilities to improve user experience. You shouldn’t just throw your Next.js app into a Docker container and call it a day—unless that’s all your case really needs.\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/selfhosting-nextjs-with-cloudflare/","title":"How to Self-Host a Next.js Application with Cloudflare"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/understanding-gradient-descent/":{"body":"Understanding Gradient Descent\nIn vector calculus, the gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative. Whereas the ordinary derivative of a function of a single variable is a scalar-valued function, the gradient of a function of several variables is a vector-valued function\n\n\nIn simple words, a gradient is a vector or matrix representing the direction of change of a function.\n\n\nWhen we train a neural network, the general goal is to minimize the loss function which is a function that compares the target output with the predicted output by our model and get the error or difference between the two of them. If our predicted output is too far from the target output, the loss function will be higher, and we want to minimize that.\nGiven that the gradient points to the direction where the function increases the most, it makes sense that we want to move in the opposite direction of the gradient to find the minimum of the function, this is the idea behind gradient descent in the context of neural networks.\nExample\nTake the simple function:\n$$\nf(x, y) = (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\n$$\nWe can compute the gradient of this function by applying the partial derivative with respect to each variable:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x + 2y = 2(x + y)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2x + 2y = 2(y + x)\n$$\nHence we have that our gradient is\n$$\n\\nabla f =\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2(x + y) \\ 2(y + x) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow to minimize the function, we start with two random values for $x$ and $y$, let them be $x = 3$ and $y = 4$. We can compute the gradient at this point:\n$$\n\\nabla f(3, 4) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2(3 + 4) \\ 2(4 + 3) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 14 \\ 14 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAnd the function value at this point:\n$$\nf(3, 4) = (3 + 4)^2 = 49\n$$\nThen we can make a step in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the function:\nFor $x$ we have:\n$$\nx = x - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3 - \\alpha(14) = 3 - 14\\alpha\n$$\nAnd for $y$:\n$$\ny = y - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 4 - \\alpha(14) = 4 - 14\\alpha\n$$\nWhere $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, a hyperparameter that controls how much we want to \"jump\" in the opposite direction of the gradient. We can set $\\alpha = 0.1$, then we have:\n$$\nx_{new} = 3 - 14(0.1) = 1.6\n$$\n$$\ny_{new} = 4 - 14(0.1) = 2.6\n$$\nNow computing the function value with our new values:\n$$\nf(1.6, 2.6) = (1.6 + 2.6)^2 = 17.64\n$$\nNow let's do it one more time, computing the gradient at the new points:\n$$\n\\nabla f(1.6, 2.6) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2(1.6+2.6) \\ 2(1.6+2.6) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 8.4 \\ 8.4 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAnd our new points with a learning rate $\\alpha = 0.1$:\n$$\nx_{new} = 1.6 - 0.1(8.4) = 0.76\n$$\n$$\ny_{new} = 2.6 - 0.1(8.4) = 1.76\n$$\nAnd the function value at this point:\n$$\nf(3.32, 3.68) = (0.76 + 1.76)^2 = 6.35\n$$\nWe can visualize the steps we took with the following plot:\n\n  \n\nWe can also visualize the steps we took by plotting the vector field of the gradient:\n\n  \n\nAs we can see, we start with points $x = 3$ and $y = 4$ which returned a function value of $49$, after one step in the opposite direction of the gradient, we got the points $(1.6, 2.6)$ which returned a function value of $17.64$, and finally on our second step, we got the points $(0.76, 1.76)$ which returned a function value of $6.35$, we are getting closer to the minimum of the function.\n\n\nFrom this example, we can extrapolate the following pseudocode for gradient descent on a function $f(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\ndef gradient_descent(f, x, y, alpha, iterations):\n    grad_x = derivate(f, x)\n    grad_y = derivate(f, y)\n    for i in range(iterations):\n        deriv_x = grad_x(x, y)\n        deriv_y = grad_y(x, y)\n        x = x - alpha*deriv_x\n        y = y - alpha*deriv_y\n    return x, y\n\nFinally, gradient descent can also be applied for functions that takes a matrix as input and returns a value in other dimensions. That is $f(X) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, where $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$.\nThe procedure to do gradient descent will keep the same, you calculate the gradient of the function with respect to each element of the matrix to get a matrix of partial derivatives like this:\n$$\n\\nabla f(X) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{11}} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{12}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1n}} \\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{21}} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{22}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{2n}} \\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{m1}} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{m2}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{mn}} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThen you evaluate the gradient matrix on the current matrix $X$, and you update the matrix $X$:\n$$\nX_{new} = X - \\alpha \\nabla f(X)\n$$\nExample 2\nLet's see an example of gradient descent for a Softmax Regression model. Softmax regression is a generalization of logistic regression to the case where we want to handle multiple classes.\nIn softmax regression we have an input vector $x$ with $n$ features, and we want to predict the probability for that input to belong to each of the $k$ classes. We can represent the model as:\n$$\nh_{\\theta}(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} P(y = 1 | x; \\theta) \\ P(y = 2 | x; \\theta) \\ \\vdots \\ P(y = k | x; \\theta) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWith $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$, and $h_{\\theta}(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\n\nSo our function takes an input vector and outputs another vector with the probabilities of belonging to each class. The sum of the probabilities must be equal to 1.\nTo be able to generate this function $h_{\\theta}(x)$, we need to find the parameters $\\theta$ for which the function returns the best probabilities. Before we do this, we must first define what is the best probabilities.\nThis can be done using what is known as the loss function: Loss functions for classification are computationally feasible loss functions representing the price paid for inaccuracy of predictions in classification problems\nThere are multiple loss functions that can be used for different classification problems, in this case we will use the cross-entropy loss function. The cross-entropy loss function is defined as:\n$$\nL = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} y_{ij} \\log(h_{\\theta}(x_i))_j\n$$\nFinal notes\nGradient descent is one of the foundational algorithms in neural networks and machine learning. It is used to find the minimum of a function by iteratively moving in the opposite direction of the gradient. In Neural Networks, the loss function is minimized using gradient descent to update the weight of the networks and decrease the error of the model.\nReferences\n\nWikipedia - Gradient Descent\nIntroduction to Deep Learning: From Logical Calculus to Artificial Intelligence\nDatacuber clases UAI\nStandford Softmax Regression\n\n","id":"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/understanding-gradient-descent/","title":"Understanding gradient descent"},"https://blog.alvarop.dev/posts/xv6-installation/":{"body":"Instalacion de dependencias xv6-riscv\nEste gist es una guia rapida para instalar las dependencias necesarias para compilar y correr el kernel de xv6-riscv.
