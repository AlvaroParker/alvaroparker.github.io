Hi! I'm Alvaro Parker ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software developer from Chile currently studying for my Master of Science in Engineering. Iâ€™m passionate about software development, low level programming using languages like Rust, C, C++ or even assembly. Iâ€™m somewhat familiar with reverse engineering but not as much as I would want.

I've made small contributions to [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm), [xmpp-rs](https://gitlab.com/xmpp-rs/xmpp-rs), [Zed code editor](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)
and even the [Linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-block.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=2be6190cd75cd2029ced5ccef057e15939f48c4a)
kernel (this one was a really short contribution but it's a start!). I'm hopping to start contributing even more to open source so if you have a project
and you are looking for help (specially if it's written in Rust), I would be happy to assist.

I also like developing web apis, specially on Golang and Rust. Examples of web apis I made using Golang and Rust are [Web-console](https://github.com/AlvaroParker/web-console)
which is a website to interact with docker containers using a command line on the browser and [lab-control](https://github.com/AlvaroParker/lab-control) which is a software
to do access control using fingerprint scanning.
