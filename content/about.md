Hi! I'm Alvaro Parker ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software developer from Chile currently studying for my Master of Science in Engineering. I'm passionate about software development, low-level programming using languages like Rust, C, C++, or even assembly. I'm also somewhat familiar with reverse engineering. I also have experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and with technologies like Kubernetes (entry level), Docker, CI/CD, ONNX, and more.

In my previous jobs I've:

- [x] Worked integrating machine learning models into production using ONNX with C# and delivering inference services over XMPP using C# and JavaScript.
- [x] Worked with Cloudflare streaming for video delivery, storage, and upload using TypeScript, webhooks, and Cloudflare workers.
- [x] Worked with Kubernetes to deploy and manage a cluster of worker nodes for simulations.

I've made small contributions to [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm), [xmpp-rs](https://gitlab.com/xmpp-rs/xmpp-rs), [Zed code editor](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed),
[Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo),
and even the [Linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-block.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=2be6190cd75cd2029ced5ccef057e15939f48c4a)
kernel (this one was a really short contribution but it's a start!). I'm hoping to start contributing even more to open source, so if you have a project
and you are looking for help (especially if it's written in Rust), I would be happy to assist.

I also like developing web APIs, especially in Go and Rust. Examples of web APIs I made using Go and Rust are [Web-console](https://github.com/AlvaroParker/web-console),
which is a website to interact with Docker containers using a command line on the browser, and [lab-control](https://github.com/AlvaroParker/lab-control), which is software
to do access control using fingerprint scanning.
